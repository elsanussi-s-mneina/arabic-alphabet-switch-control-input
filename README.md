# arabic-alphabet-switch-control-input

 Writing the Arabic alphabet using a switch control.

The file was made using Panel Editor Version 2.0 on Mac OS Mojave.

By using this file you get access to all the usual characters used to write the Arabic language in the Arabic script.

## Purpose

The switch control panel is for inputing the 28 Arabic characters of the alphabet. The 4 other characters,
and the diacritics (تشكيل).

The benefit of this layout is that it is easier for beginners to find each letter because the buttons are ordered
roughly in alphabetical order from right to left. They are also ordered by similar shape and number of dots vertically.
This may help a user search for a letter more quickly instead of using the more jumbled layout of a more traditional
keyboard.

The other advantage is that the diacritic (سكون، ضمة، فتحة) characters are labelled.

Feel free to use this for any purpose, and to share it.
